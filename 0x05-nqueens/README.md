Backtracking is a problem-solving algorithmic technique that involves finding
a solution incrementally by trying different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead end.
It is commonly used in situations where you need to explore multiple possibilities to solve a problem,
like searching for a path in a maze or solving puzzles like Sudoku.
When a dead end is reached,
the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision point and explores a different path until
a solution is found or all possibilities have been exhausted.

Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique
that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem.
